// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.

// Challenge 1
// Use a for statement to log to the console all even numbers between 25 and 75.
for (var i = 24; i < 78; i += 2) {
  console.log("10: " + i);
}


// Challenge 2
// Use a for statement to log to the console a complete sentence stating the weather using the Array below:
weather_options = ["sunny", "snowy", "freezing", "partly cloudy", "drizzly"];
for (var i = 0; i < weather_options.length; i++) {
  console.log("There is a lot of weather one will see in Colorado, they could be:" + weather_options[i]);
}

// Challenge 3
// Use a for statement to log to the console only the words that are exactly 3 characters in length
var words = ["car", "bike", "bus", "van", "scooter", "truck", "rv"]

for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
  if (words[i].length === 3) {
  console.log("List of words with three letters: " + words[i]);
  }
}
// ðŸ“¹ Record yourself live-coding and talking through any ONE of the challenges.
  // The recording doesn't have to be the first time you are solving the problem.
  // Use technical vocabulary and explain each part to demonstrate your understanding!
